# aquila astrophotography package

**aquila** is a package designed to be a minimalist tool for initial steps of astrophotography data processing.
There is a shortage of easy to use tools for Linux.
Moreover, most tools in existence do not work well from terminal, which is a natural tool for managing and organizing hundreds of image files during stacking etc.
Popular tools like IRAF are not friendly for quick use by amateur astronomers.
**aquila** is intended to fill that void.

Currently, the package consists of following programs:

1. ``aqstack`` for stacking and reduction of monochromatic CCD images
2. ``aqlrgb`` for compositing images from many filters into one color picture
